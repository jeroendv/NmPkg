* write documentations and use-cases
* unit test the use cases

* integrate should:
  + add Conan.Targets
  + add conanfile.txt

* add imports based on 'conan_imports_manifest.txt'
  <Target Name="ConanImports" AfterTargets="Build">
    <Message Text="Copy conan imported files to the build output directory" Importance="high" />
  </Target>

* add imports targets preferably one that used symlinks from the packages themselves to avoid copying
  I.e. there is also no [imports] section in the conanfile.txt because that will copy the files
  alternatively make sure that the copy is timestamp aware to avoid copying file that are already there

* add version number to Conan.Targets

* add a 'verify' command 
  + check program invars
  + verify version

* add a 'pip install conan_vs_integration -u' target to conan.Targets

* add conan to deps of this package
