* write documentations and use-cases
* unit test the use cases

* instead of passing the configuration to the 'install command' it would be robuster to pass
    + the debug vs. release settings
    + the unicode vs. non-unicode settings
  this way there is no ambiguity due to the arbitrarily choosen configuration name.

* add toolset condition instead of VS version condition to the buildProperties.
  see also : https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/966

* integrate should:
  + add Conan.Targets
  + add conanfile.txt

* add imports based on 'conan_imports_manifest.txt'
  <Target Name="ConanImports" AfterTargets="Build">
    <Message Text="Copy conan imported files to the build output directory" Importance="high" />
  </Target>

* add imports targets preferably one that used symlinks from the packages themselves to avoid copying
  I.e. there is also no [imports] section in the conanfile.txt because that will copy the files
  alternatively make sure that the copy is timestamp aware to avoid copying file that are already there

* add version number to Conan.Targets

* detect if conan_vs_integration tool is missing or outdated?
  optionally automatically install/update it?
  add a 'pip install conan_vs_integration -u' target to conan.Targets?

* add conan to deps of this package

* verify that the 'visual_studio_toolset_multi' generator is used!

* verify that the conanfile.txt is part of the project

* how to run the tool for all projects prior to invoking msbuild in cc.net
  problem: which settings are used by the solutions?
